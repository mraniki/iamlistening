    Listener Class for IAmListening.

    This class provides methods for starting and stopping the listener
    for each platform.

    Methods:
        _create_client(self, **kwargs)
        get_all_client_classes(self)
        get_info(self)
        start(self)

        Initializes the class instance by creating and appending clients
        based on the configuration in `settings.platform`.

        Checks if the module is enabled by looking at `settings.iamlistening_enabled`.
        If the module is disabled, no clients will be created.

        Creates a mapping of library names to client classes.
        This mapping is used to create new clients based on the configuration.

        If a client's configuration exists in `settings.platform` and its "enabled"
        key is truthy, it will be created.
        Clients are not created if their name is "template" or empty string.

        If a client is successfully created, it is appended to the `clients` list.

        If a client fails to be created, a message is logged with the name of the
        client and the error that occurred.

        Parameters:
            None

        Create a client based on the given protocol.

        This function takes in a dictionary of keyword arguments, `kwargs`,

        key in `kwargs` is "library", which specifies the protocol to use for
        communication with the LLM. The value of "platform" must match one of the
        libraries supported by iamlistening.

        This function retrieves the class used to create the client based on the
        value of "library" from the mapping of library names to client classes

        match any of the libraries supported, the function logs an error message

        new instance of the class using the keyword arguments in `kwargs` and
        returns it.
